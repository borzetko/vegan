		<h1><font size="7">Nutritions</font></h1>
		<p><font size="5">When starting with vegan diet you need to make sure that you are taking enough vitamins/proteins/fruits+veggies and also keep your  balance. I get this questions where I get my protein,vitamin B12 all the time. „Secret“ is to know what vitamins you should have daily on your plate.And it´s also important to know which food contains what nutrition.</font> </p>
		<br><br><br><br>
            <h2><font size="7">What should be always on your plate?</font></h2>
		<p><font size="5">Fruit and vegetable – they can be dried,frozen,fresh.“An apple a day keeps doctors away.“ But really eat your fruits and vegies daily. Even though you are not vegan. Fruits contains many important nutrtions like fiber,potassioum and of course vitamin C. Also if you are wondering whitch vegetable is most healthy – it´s a kale.<br><br>
            Fiber such as oats, sweet potatoes, wholegrain food-brown rice,wholwheat rice. Omega 3 such as nuts and seeds. Protein for example lentils, tofu,soya, soy milk, peanut butter...</font>

            </p><h3><font size="6">Which vitamins and where?</font></h3>
            <p><font size="5">Vitamin B12-every plant milk , but soy is more recommended. Also be sure that you are recieving vitamins such as:</font><ul>

        <h4><font size="6">Life hacks</font> </h4>
            <p><font size="5">For days when you have no time. Did u heard about meal prep? Is absolutely great thing and it´s based on preparing your food ( can be for a day, few days or whole week). You can prepare your food day before like cooking potatoes, rice, making sendwich or anything you like. And you can get healthy and nutritonal food and it takes you zero time in the morning.</font><br><br>
<font size="5">Another life hack is to write a list with grocery list for a week and also plan your food for a week. You  can wrote ideas about breakfest, lunches, dinner ideas and also snacks. This life hack can save u a lot of time searching for ideas to dinner on pinterest every day. So sit down every Sunday and prepare your shopping list.</font>
