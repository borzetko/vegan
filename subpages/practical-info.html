		<p class= "textik">If Beyonce, Madona, Ariana Grande, Mike Tyson and Jim Carrey could do it , why do YOU think, that you can´t? And yes, they are all proud vegans.I wish I was born this way (vegan).I wonder why I was crazy all those years.(Mike Tyson)</p>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h1>What is veganism ?</h1>
		<p class= "textik">It means avoiding (you can look but shouldn´t eat them) all animal products- meat, eggs ,dairy products and also honey. When I tell somebody about veganism, most of the time the response is the same: I love cheese/meat/eggs so much, I can´t go fully vegan even though I want to.
		</p><br>
		<p class= "textik">To be honest , we are living in the 21st century and you can easily get/buy/prepare all substitutions you could think of. If you are interested ,  check article about substitutions (click here)

		<h1>Why go vegan?</h1>
		<p class= "textik">Except the fact , that you are not supporting animal sloughterhouses and dairy factories. Ther is is even more...
		People starting to realize , that animals and every other beings should have the right to live. And also going fully  vegan or minimaze meat for a week helps  our planet .For example if your meal consists of vegetable/fruits  usage of water was 7 time less comparing to meat on your plate
		.Animal agriculture is one of the most destructive forces to our earth these  days. Why ? For example greenhouse gases from animals

		<p class= "textik">And if you really think about it . Common it´s way more ethical...Your body and soul would be grateful too..
		</p><br><p class= "textik">Vegan diet is really healthy, you get all proteins, vitamins , fiber you need.I don´t really like words vegan diet because veganism is not a diet at all. Also vegan recipes are really delicious and not as hard as you may think.
		"Happiness is founding out there is a vegan option."
        And don´t forget: These kind of things-changing your lifestyle takes some time and it´s absolutelly your choice what are you  eating.
